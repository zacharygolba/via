# Via

Welcome to **Via**, an asynchronous web framework for Rust, designed to be simple, flexible, and efficient. With Via, you can build fast and reliable web applications using familiar Rust patterns and modern async features.

## Features

-   **Asynchronous**: Built on top of `tokio`, leveraging the full power of async programming in Rust.
-   **Lightweight**: Minimalistic API with no unnecessary abstractions or dependencies.
-   **Flexible Routing**: Simple and intuitive path parameter handling.
-   **Customizable**: Fine-grained control over requests, responses, and error handling.

## Getting Started

Add the following to dependencies section of your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
via = "2.0.0-gm"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread", "signal"] }
```

## Hello World Example

Below is a basic example to demonstrate how to use Via to create a simple web server that responds to requests at `/hello/:name` with a personalized greeting.

```rust
use std::process::ExitCode;
use via::{Error, Next, Request, Response, Server};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<ExitCode, Error> {
    let mut app = via::app(());

    // Define a route that listens on /hello/:name.
    app.route("/hello/:name").to(via::get(hello));

    Server::new(app).listen(("127.0.0.1", 8080)).await
}

async fn hello(request: Request, _: Next) -> via::Result {
    // Get a reference to the path parameter `name` from the request uri.
    let name = request.param("name").percent_decode().into_result()?;

    // Send a plain text response with our greeting message.
    Response::build().text(format!("Hello, {}!", name))
}
```

### Running the Example

To run this example, `cd` in to `./examples/hello-world`, and then use `cargo run`:

```sh
cargo run
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080/hello/world` in your browser, and you should see the message "Hello, world!".

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by:

-   [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) A web framework for Node.js.
-   [Tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide) The reference implementation of an async web server in Rust.
-   [Actix Web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) They paved their own way and I have so much respect for that.
-   [Rocket](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket) This project wouldn't exist if I hadn't tried to create [Rocket with classes](https://github.com/zacharygolba/via/blob/f44a3e8eeaee74cadfa2dd48cb60db5ef301aa01/docs/examples/advanced-blog/src/services/api/posts.rs).
-   [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) Via is built on top of hyper. Without warp, Via wouldn't exist! Also, warp has the coolest API I've ever used to write a web server.
